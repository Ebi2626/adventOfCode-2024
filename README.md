# Advent of code 2024

This repository will contain my solutions for tasks from adventofcode challenge for 2024.

Each solutions will have it's own folder with number of day.

## Usage

To compile the source files, you need the g++ compiler and make installed on your operating system.

From the main folder of this project, simply run `make` in the terminal to build executable files for all available solutions.

Once the executables are ready, you can run them directly from the terminal.

By default, the program reads input from the `input.txt` file. If you want to use a different file, provide the file's path as a command-line argument. For example: `2/solution /path/to/your/file.txt`
